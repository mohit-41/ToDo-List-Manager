# ToDo-List-Manager
* I have created a responsive website for ToDo list manager.
* It allows us to create, add and delete tasks in real-time as well as save the data in the local storage so that it won't get lost after refreshing.
* Tech stack - HTML, tailwindcss, JavaScript, React.js
* Here is the working video of the website
